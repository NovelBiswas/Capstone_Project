# Capstone_Project

With the help of an extensive dataset that includes a wide range of health variables, this study aims to create a sophisticated predictive framework for classifying different forms of diabetes. The goal is to improve diabetes diagnostic efficiency and accuracy by using machine learning algorithms, which will allow for early intervention and treatment planning.
It includes actions 
like managing missing values, encoding category variables, and standardizing numerical features. Then, a thorough investigation into several classificationalgorithms is conducted, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, CatBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN).
